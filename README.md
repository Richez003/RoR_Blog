# Blog App

The Blog app is a classic example of a blog website. I created a fully functional website that shows the list of posts and empower readers to interact with them by adding comments and liking posts.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

- Copy this link `https://github.com/Richez003/RoR_Blog`.
- Get the directory that you want to clone the repository.
- Open the command prompt in this directory.
- Write `https://github.com/Richez003/RoR_Blog`.
- Go to the repository folder in your command prompt `cd blog-app`.

- Follow these steps to run the app:
  - run `gem install`, then run `rails s`
